# Getting started

## Installing the project
Installation instructions can be found in the [README.md](../README.md).

## Finding the project
All packages are named MusicNotation-\<packagename\>. Just use the search function of the Squeak browser to find our code.

## Using the project
To open the editor used to create and modify music projects you can use the following command in a Squeak workspace: `MNEditor open.`
This will open the editor and you can start scripting. For an example script, type `MNEditor openTutorial` instead. More details can be found in the [scripting.md](./scripting.md).

## Understanding the project
We know it can be quite difficult to understand a project with ~14.000 lines of code by just reading all of it. So here is some help:
- [Architectural Information](./architectural-information.md)
- [Entry Points](./entry-points.md)

## Enhancing the project
You want to add new features, fix bugs or restructure the project to make it a better fit for you and others? 
#### Check out our [issues](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/MusicNotation/issues)! 
We added a few things there that might be cool to add. Those are labeled with `proposal`. Also, we didn't remove the old ones, maybe they help you to understand what we did.
Feel free to have a look!
