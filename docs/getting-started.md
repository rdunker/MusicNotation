# Getting started

## Installing the project
Installation instructions can be found in the [README.md](../README.md).

## Finding the project
All packages are named MusicNotation-\<packagename\>. Just use the search function of the Squeak browser to find our code.

## Using the project
To open the editor used to create and modify music projects you can use the following command in a Squeak workspace: `MNEditor open.`
This will open the editor and you can start scripting. More details can be found in the [scripting.md](./scripting.md).

## Understanding the project
We know it can be quite difficult to understand a project with ~12.000 lines of code by just reading all of it. So here is some help:
- [Architectural Information](./architectural-information.md)
- [Entry Points](./entry-points.md)

## Enhancing the project
You want to add new features, fix bugs or restructure the project to make it a better fit for you and others? 
#### Check out our [issues](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/MusicNotation/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/MusicNotation/pulls)! 
We added a few things there that might be cool to add. Those are labeled with "proposal". Also, we didn't remove the old ones, maybe they help you to understand what we did.
Furthermore, the open pull requests are features that are already partly implemented but not quite finished. Feel free to have a look!
